==================================
Welcome to ANLffr's documentation!
==================================

From the `Auditory Neuroscience Lab at Boston University <http://www.cns.bu.edu/~shinn/ANL/index.html>`_, 
a set of tools to analyze and interpret auditory steady-state responses, 
particularly the subcortical kind commonly known as frequency-following responses (FFRs). 
In particular, the package provides code for multitaper-analysis of spectra and phase locking 
along with complex-principal component analysis of phase-locking for multichannel FFRs.
The manuscript describing the complex-PCA method
to extract FFRs from multichannel recordings is
`Bharadwaj & Shinn-Cunningham (2014) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245714000443>`_.
Support for "bootstrapping" any of the included functions is also available. 
The code repository lives on `github <http://github.com/haribharadwaj/ANLffr>`_. 
See the `Introduction <intro.html>`_ page for instructions to obtain your copy.
A pdf version of the latest documentation can be found `here <http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~hari/ANLffr.pdf>`_.
